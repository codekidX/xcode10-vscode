# Xcode 10

> v0.1.x

Xcode10 is a theme based on Apple's Xcode version 10, which was released way
long ago and had an awesome dark theme. The color combinations in the new
versions are inspired from various themes like Boxy, Gruvbox and many others
but the base Xcode 10 colors somewhat is conveyed the same.
